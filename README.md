# StreamLit_App

Download the collected_tweets.csv dataset to test

Access App from: https://twitter-analysis-streaml.streamlit.app/

Google Colab Notebook with additional codes and tests: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MBv77fwfCoPlt5N3AwoXPWteLcu7TIMA?usp=sharing 

The file saved as “collected_tweets.csv” must be downloaded prior accessing the app, as it contains the dataset with tweets for the missing person “Nikol Angelova”. 
Once the file is downloaded and the app is launched, upload the file from the “Browse Files” button as shown below:

It should not take more than a couple of seconds for the file to be uploaded. After that the app will apply all analysis and visualisation as discussed in the Methodology chapter, except for performing data collection functionality. 
* Use the interactive maps by zooming in and out, and hover the mouse on top of points for details
* The app will automatically apply analyses to entire dataset
* To apply analysis based on specific location, select extracted entity from the dropdown list and wait until new analyses are displayed (it should take a couple of second)

* Keep in mind some functionalities take longer to process data, which does not necessarily mean it does not work
